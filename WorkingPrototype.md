# Smart Attendance Workflow (Fast, Anti-Proxy, Step-by-Step)

## 1. Teacher Photo Step (Fastest, Most Automated)
- **Teacher opens the attendance app/portal, clicks a photo of the class.**
- **Clicks 'Upload & Mark' button.**
- AI runs face recognition on the photo, matches faces with registered student images.
- **If a student’s face is matched with >90% confidence**, they are **instantly marked present**.

## 2. Push Notification to Unmarked Students
- Students who are **not recognized/marked present** get an instant push notification:  
  “You were not marked present by AI. Please complete alternate verification.”
- Their names roll up on the teacher’s portal as “Unmarked.”

## 3. QR Code Fallback (With Location & WiFi Verification)
- **Teacher clicks 'Generate QR'** (only available if unmarked students exist).
- QR appears on teacher’s screen, **expires in 10 seconds**.
- **Unmarked students scan the QR using their app.**
    - **App requires:**
        - Student is connected to college WiFi (SSID check).
        - Student’s location is inside the campus (Google Maps API geofence).
        - (Optional) Device Bluetooth proximity to teacher’s device for extra anti-proxy.

## 4. Biometric Fallback (Final Step for Remaining Students)
- **If after QR step, any students are still unmarked:**
    - **Teacher enables 'Biometric Marking'** for these specific students.
    - Biometric scanner can be:
        - **Mobile phone fingerprint/face unlock** (if student’s device supports it; use OS biometric API).
        - **External biometric device/kiosk** (laptop USB fingerprint reader or classroom tablet).
    - Student scans their finger/face on device or at a kiosk.
    - System checks biometric against registered template and marks present if matched.

## 5. Teacher Final Review (Optional)
- Teacher sees summary:  
    - Who was marked present by photo  
    - Who used QR  
    - Who used biometric  
    - Who is still unmarked (possible absentees)
- Manual override is possible for genuine cases (e.g., medical, device issue).

## **How This Prevents Proxy & Saves Time**
| Step         | Time Needed | Proxy Risk | Verification Used           |
|--------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| Photo (AI)   | <1 minute   | Very Low   | Face AI, database match     |
| QR Fallback  | <1 minute   | Very Low   | QR+WiFi+Location+Optionally Bluetooth |
| Biometric    | <2 minutes  | Negligible | Fingerprint/face scan       |

- **Photo AI**: No student can be marked present unless physically in the photo.
- **QR**: Only unmarked, in-campus, WiFi-connected students can use it.
- **Biometric**: Impossible to proxy, needs registered fingerprint/face.

## **How to Implement Biometric Step**
1. **Mobile-based**:  
    - Use Android/iOS biometric authentication API (`BiometricPrompt` for Android, `LocalAuthentication` for iOS).
    - Attendance app prompts student for fingerprint/face unlock.
    - If authenticated, app sends confirmation to backend (no raw biometric data sent, just authentication pass/fail).
2. **Kiosk-based**:  
    - USB fingerprint or face scanner at classroom entrance or with teacher.
    - Student taps finger/face; scanner checks against template and marks attendance.

---

## **Extra Security Tips**
- Require both location and WiFi checks for QR fallback.
- Store only biometric templates/hashes (never raw images).
- Log all fallback attempts for audit.

---

## **User Experience Summary**
- Most students marked present in seconds via AI photo.
- Only a small number (missed by AI) need to do QR, then biometric as last resort.
- **No time is wasted. Proxy attendance is nearly impossible.**

---

## **What to Build**
1. Teacher app/portal for photo, QR, biometric control.
2. Student app with scan, biometric, and push notification features.
3. Backend with AI face recognition, QR validation, location/WiFi check, biometric support.
4. Simple admin dashboard for audit and manual review.
